### Documentation

#### Abstract Class
- BaseReader : Base class for all readers.
#### Primitive Reader
All primitive type readers except StringReader do not use resolver.
```js
read(buffer, resolver)
{
	const int32Reader = new Int32Reader();
	const value = int32Reader.read(buffer);
}
write(buffer, content, resolver)
{
	const int32Reader = new Int32Reader();
	int32Reader.write(buffer, content, null);
}
```

#### Complex-type Reader
- Texture2DReader : A reader that can read and write **Texture2D** type. Included DXT compression.
- LightweightTexture2DReader : A reader that can read and write **Texture2D** type. Excluded DXT compression. This is useful when you want to extract only sprite data that contains png data.

If you want use LightweightTexture2DReader, you should *rename* this reader to Texture2DReader when importing it.
```js
import {LightweightTexture2DReader as Texture2DReader} from "@xnb/readers";

setReaders({Texture2DReader});
```
